## Purpose ##

Bootstrap setup on a new UNIX system.

## Usage ##

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsmith89/bootstrap/master/aws
chmod +x aws
./aws
```

In this case

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsmith89/bootstrap/master/aws | bash
```

would also work, but only because `./aws` is a Bash script.
